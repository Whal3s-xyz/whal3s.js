## Description

Developer platform to easily create, deliver & manage any kind of token utility.
This library is used to quickly and efficiently integrate the Whal3s developer platform into your existing tech stack. It is written in TypeScript, but thanks to UMD build it also offers support for vanilla JS or frameworks like React or Angular.

## Documentation

## Requirements

npm install whal3s.js
```

## Usage

## Tests

The JavaScript Templates project comes with
[Unit Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing).  
There are two different ways to run the tests:

- Open test/index.html in your browser or
- run `npm test` in the Terminal in the root path of the repository package.

The first one tests the browser integration, the second one the
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) integration.
